# Jeff Loughridge 

Welcome to my Github page.

I am passionate about the cloud and building things on its foundation. I use my Github repos and gists
to share tidbits with others and to document the same for myself. Remembering things is hard!


By day, I am the CTO of [Konekti Systems](https://konekti.us). We advise clients on building secure
infrastructure in the cloud. I appreciate the business our clients have given us. 


The best way to reach me is by emailing [jeffl@konekti.us](mailto:jeffl@konekti.us).


I'm active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffloughridge/). I occasionally 
[tweet](https://twitter.com/jeffbrl) when the mood strikes me.
